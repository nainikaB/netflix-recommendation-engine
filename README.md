# netflix-recommendation-engine

Please find the app deployed here  - https://netflix-recommender-system.herokuapp.com/

While I have successfully portrayed the recommendations with usability and convenience in mind, I would have ideally liked the app to display recommendations with posters and ratings and so I'm currently working to improve the experience in the following ways:
- Since the netflix api isn't available and I wasn't aware of it at the time of starting the project, I'm nevertheless working to incorporate another similar api such as IMDB. I'm currently in the researching and experimenting phase to see if it's feasible or not
- Improve the look and feel of the app in general
