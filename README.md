# netflix-recommendation-engine

Here is the app deployed - https://netflix-recommender-system.herokuapp.com/

While I have successfully portrayed the recommendations with usability and convenience in mind, I would have ideally liked the app to display recommendation with posters and ratings. And so I'm currently working to improve the experience in the following ways:
- Since the netflix api isn't available and I wasn't aware of it at the time of starting the project, I'm nevertheless working to incorporate another similar api such as IMDB although I'm researching and experimenting currently to see if it's feasible or not
- Improve the look and feel of the app in general
